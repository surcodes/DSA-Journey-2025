Goal: Build strong problem-solving skills before my birthday (12th Nov).

Oct: Stacks, Queues, Trees

ðŸ“… Weekly Logs
Week 3 (Sept 08 â€“ Sept 14)

Restarted my DSA journey.

Began with C++ basics: input/output, variables, conditionals.

Wrote small programs (sum of numbers, simple patterns).

Set the foundation to move towards arrays next week.

ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

Practice loops, arrays, and functions in C++.

Start solving beginner-level problems (like array reversal, max/min element).

Build consistency â†’ even 1 problem a day counts.
